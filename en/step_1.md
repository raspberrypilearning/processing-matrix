When using `rotate()` and `translate()` functions you can save the coordinate settings by using the `pushMatrix()` function then restore those coordinate settings using the `popMatrix()` function.

In this example, to create two rotating eyes, the settings are saved before either of the eyes are drawn. The screen is translated and rotated before the first eye is drawn then the settings restored before the second eye is drawn.

def eye():

# Create an eye
  fill(WHITE)
  ellipse(0, 0, 150, 150) # Outer eye
  no_stroke()
  fill(BLUE)
  ellipse(0, 0, 80, 80) # Iris
  fill(BLACK)
  ellipse(0, 0, 35, 35) # Pupil
  fill(WHITE, 70)
  ellipse(-25, -20, 30, 30) # Catchlight 1 with opacity
  ellipse(25, 25, 10, 10) # Catchlight 2 with opacity

def draw():

  global BLUE, BLACK, WHITE

  BLUE = color(1, 32, 100)
  BLACK = color(0, 0, 0)
  WHITE = color(255, 255, 255)

  background(WHITE)
  translate(width/2, height/2) # Move screen to the middle

  stroke(BLACK)
  ellipse(0, 0, 300, 300) # Head

  pushMatrix() # Saves current screen settings

  translate(-100, 0) # Move screen to the left for left eye
  for i in range(frame_count):
    eye()
    rotate(radians(45))

  popMatrix() # Restores previous screen settings (removes the eye translation and rotation)

  translate(100, 0) # Move screen to the right for right eye
  for i in range(frame_count):
    eye()
    rotate(radians(45))
